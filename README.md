# Website for budgeting of civil construction projects

Developed for the Integrative Project subject during a Technical Course in Information Technology.

## Development steps

### 1 - Creating the database

The database was built with MySQL, using MySQL Workbench. The physical model was first developed, then reverse-engineered for the logical/graphical model

### 2 - Building the API

Being the main part of the project, it was built using TypeScript, Node.js and Express, through the use of tools such as Visual Studio Code and Insomnia. Additionally, Nodemon was used to compile and run the server.

### 3 - Building the cliente / front-end

The client was created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, using axios to connect to the API when necessary
